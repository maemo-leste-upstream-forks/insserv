    /etc/init.d/, and made previously failing loop breaking test

insserv (1.09.0-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * New patch 34_debian_fixedscripts to hardcode a few script sequence
    numbers, to let the generated boot sequence be more like the
    original one.  Modified 40_nonsusescripts to no longer disable the

    not obvious that it is a good idea.
  * Added override files for hostname.dhcp and mountfix.
  * Adjust override file for lvm2, to provide both lvm2 and lvm, to
    make it easier until the lvm provide is dropped.

    mountall and umountfs to make it possible to drop lvm relations
    from initscripts.

    dependency based boot (Closes: #458683).
  * Move code to divert update-rc.d from postinst to
    update-bootsystem-insserv, to make sure both ways to activate
    insserv are equivalent.
  * Extended check-initd-order to graph services with multiple
    provides as two nodes that depend on each other, and which ahve
    the same dependencies.
  * Changed update-bootsystem-insserv to call 'reset' after looping
    over packages postinst scripts, in case the terminal is messed up
    as it is when I test it.
  * Disabled check for reverse dependencies in check-initd-order.  It
    does not to work properly, and gave false error reports.
  * Removed flag file /etc/update-rc.d-insserv and use the update-rc.d
    diversion as the flag to detect if insserv is enabled.  Adjustd
    package removal and update-rc.d-insserv to reflect this.
  * Added Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser info in control file, pointing to
    the Debian packaging project.

    non-existing postinst scripts, and only run postinst scripts for
    packages with executable scripts in /etc/init.d/.
  * Extended check-initd-order to check optional start dependencies,
    and implement check of the shutdown sequence.
  * Extended to check reverse dependencies too.
  * Changed enabling code to refuse to convert to dependency based
    boot sequence when obsolete init.d scripts are found, as these
    tend to mess up the boot sequence.
  * Changed enabling code to refuse to convert to dependency based
    boot sequence if several scripts provide the same service.
  * Added prerm code to refuse to be removed while enabled, to avoid
    messing up the boot system completely.

insserv (1.08.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change update-bootsystem-insserv to refuse to convert the boot
    system if there are dependency loops.
  * New patch 37_consistent_path to make more consistent log output.
  * Adjust the the rules file to make sure we build using the compiler options
    specified there.
  * New patch 33_debian_localok making .local a valid ending,
    to accept script names like 'rc.local'.
  * New patch 38_debuginfo to improve the debug output.
  * New patch 39_debianlvl.dpatch to handle rcS.d/ a bit better.
  * Add override for mountdevsubfs.sh, documenting its
    relation to udev.
  * Add override for stop-bootlogd, documenting that it should come late,
    after rmnologin.
  * Make it easier to enable the dependency based boot system by
    adding a fairly well hidden debconf question to activate it.
  * Adjust the override files for dns-clean, hotplug, hotplug-net,
    hwclock.sh, keymap.sh, libdevmapper1.00, libdevmapper1.01,
    libdevmapper1.02, modutils, nviboot and procps.sh to make sure
    they only start in runlevel S.
  * Adjust override file for acpid, nstxd and nstxcd, to make sure
    they are not started in runlevel S.
  * Adjust override file for makedev and rmnologin, there is
    no reason to add stop links for them.
  * Remove 'S' from all override files listing it in should-stop.  It
    never make sense to add stop scripts in rcS.d/.
  * Allow check-initd-order to continue even if one file is unreadable.
  * Add override files for apt-index-watcher, vbesave, acpi-support
    and libnss-ldap.
  * Correct the definition of $remote_fs to include mountnfs,
    mountnfs-bootclean and umountnfs.
  * Correct the definition of $local_fs to include mountfs,
    mountfs-bootclean and umountfs.
  * Adjust the override file for openbsd-inetd, to make sure it start
    after /usr/ is mounted.
