.SH DESCRIPTION
.B insserv
enables an installed system init script (`boot script')
by reading the comment header of the script, e.g.:
.sp 1
.in +1l
.nf
 ### BEGIN INIT INFO
 # Provides:       boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
 # Required-Start: boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
 # Required-Stop:  boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
 # Should-Start:   boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
 # Should-Stop:    boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
 # X-Start-Before: boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
 # X-Stop-After:   boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
 # Default-Start:  run_level_1 [ run_level_2 ...]
 # Default-Stop:   run_level_1 [ run_level_2 ...]
 # Description:    multiline_description
 ### END INIT INFO
.fi
.in -1l
.sp 1
and calculating the dependencies between all scripts.
Please note, that the
.BR Required-Stop,
.BR Should-Stop ,
.BR X-Stop-After,
and
.B Default\-Stop
are ignored in SuSE Linux, because the SuSE boot script concept
uses a differential link scheme (see
.IR init.d (7)).
The optional
.B X\-Start\-Before
keyword implies that the script using this keyword
should be started
.B before
the specified service names. This implies that those
services now depend on the specifying script.
With known dependencies and runlevel(s)
.B insserv
sets and reorders the corresponding symbolic links
of the concerned runlevels directories (see
.IR init.d (7)).
Known runlevels are:
.sp 1
.in +1l
.nf
 \fB0\fR\   used for System halt
 \fB1\fR\   used for single user mode
 \fB2\fR\   used for local multiuser without remote network
 \fB3\fR\   used for full multiuser with network
 \fB4\fR\   reserved for local use
 \fB5\fR\   used for full multiuser with network and xdm
 \fB6\fR\   used for System reboot
 \fBS\fR\   used during boot into single user mode
 \fBB\fR\   used during boot before any other runlevel
.fi
.in -1l
.sp 1
.PP
.B insserv
scans for
.B System Facilities
in the configuration file
.I /etc/insserv.conf
and each file in the directory
.IR /etc/insserv.conf.d/ .
Each line which begins with
.B $
and a following name defines a system facility
accordingly to the Linux Standard Base Specification (LSB),
All names followed by such a system facility
will declare the required dependencies of the facility.
Here is an example for
.IR /etc/insserv.conf :
.sp 1
.in +1l
.nf
 # All local filesystems are mounted
 # (done during boot phase)
 $local_fs       boot

 # Low level networking
 $network        network route

 # Named is operational
 $named          named

 # All remote filesystems are mounted
 # (in some cases /usr may be remote).
 $remote_fs      $local_fs nfs

 # System logger is operational
 $syslog         syslog

 # All network daemons are running
 $netdaemons     portmap inetd

 # Services which need to be interactive
 <interactive>   boot.crypto
.fi
.in -1l
.sp 1
Names starting with a `+' sign are marked as optional.
If the service with the name after the plus sign is
available it will be used, if not available it is
ignored silently.  Words beginning with
.B <
and ending with
.B >
are keywords.  Currently
.B <interactive>
is the only know keyword for marking a service
as an interactive one, e.g. a service which requires
a passphrase or password input during boot
or runlevel change.
.P
Beside the defined
.B System Facilities
in the configuration file
.IR /etc/insserv.conf ,
.B insserv
also knows the special facility
.BR $all .
This facility indicates that a service should be inserted
at the end of all services.  Clearly all services using
this facility will be grouped into one starting order.
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
Currently there are only four options for
.BR insserv .
.TP
.BR \-v ,\  \-\-verbose
Write out what is currently going on.
.TP
.BR \-n ,\  \-\-dryrun
Do not update symlinks.
.TP
.BR \-r ,\  \-\-remove
Remove the listed scripts from all runlevels.
.TP
.BR \-d ,\  \-\-default
Use default runlevels a defined in the scripts.
This may restore an edited runlevel link scheme.
.TP
.BR \-f ,\  \-\-force
Ignore if a required service is missed.
.TP
.BR \-h ,\  \-\-help
Print out short usage message.
.PP
But you may use the argument syntax described in the
following section.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.RI [[ / ] path/to/init.d/ ]
Relative or absolute path to the init scripts base directory.
For the SuSE Linux boot concept, this defaults to
.I /etc/init.d/
in compliance with the LSB specification.
In this case
.B insserv
does not add or remove a script to the runlevels
declared in the script headers, but may re\-order the
runlevels if the order of the currently enabled scripts
has changed (see option
.BR \-d ).
Note that if a relative path is used
.B insserv
has to be called from the root directory.
.TP
.RI [[ / ] path/to/init.d/ ] script\ ...
List of scripts which have to be added to
the runlevels. If a path is used it
should point to the absolute or relative
location of the boot scripts.
.B insserv
checks for the existence of these scripts.
For the runlevels the information found in
the script is used.
.TP
.RI [[ / ] path/to/init.d/ ] script [ ,start=<lvl1> [ ,<lvl2> ]]\ ...
List of scripts which have to be added to
the specified runlevels to be started with.
You may use this extension to overwrite the default values
for start and stop runlevels of the script.
Note that
.BR <lvl1> ,\  <lvl2> ,\ ...
are the known runlevels explained above.
The extension
.IR ,stop=<lvl1> [ ,<lvl2> ]]
is possible but ignored on SuSE Linux.
.TP
.RI \fB\-r\fR\ [[ / ] path/to/init.d/ ] script\ ...
List of scripts which should be removed from
the runlevels. If a path is used it
should point to the absolute or relative
location of the boot scripts.
.B insserv
checks for the existence of these scripts.
.\"
.SH EXIT CODES
The exit codes have the following conditions:
.RS 7
.IP 0 5
Service was successfully installed or removed
.IP 1 5
Service was not installed or removed
.RE
.RS 5
.SH NOTE
Please be aware that the following patterns of
boot script file names will be not accepted by
.BR insserv:
.sp 1
.in +1l
.nf
        *.local
        *.rpm*
        *.ba*
        *.old
        *.new
        *.org
        *.orig
        *.save
        *.swp
        *.core
        *~
.fi
.in -1l
.sp 1
with the wildcard character
.BR * .
Beside this all boot script file names beginning with one
of the following characters
.sp 1
.in +1l
.nf
        $.#%_+-\\*[]^:()~
.fi
.in -1l
.sp 1
will be ignored.
.SH BUGS
Boot script sometimes misses comments.
.SH FILES

.I /etc/insserv.conf
