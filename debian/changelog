insserv (1.08.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor change to the template text, explaining that the S* symlinks
    are renamed to K* symlinks in rc0.d/ and rc6.d/.
  * Correct override file for sysklogd and klogd.  These should not
    start in runlevel S, and should stop in runlevel 1.
  * Add $syslog to the dependency list for openbsd-inetd, to make sure
    it can log its start to syslog.  Drop $local_fs, as it is a
    dependency for $remote_fs.
  * New patch debian/patches/40_nosusescript to avoid inserting the
    'single' script showing up in runlevel S, and also avoid fixing
    the sequence number to the values used by SuSe.
  * Correct override file for hotplug-net, it should depend on $local_fs.
  * Correct override file for hotplut, it should stop before $local_fs.
  * Modify patch 31_debian_conf to also list ifupdown as part of the
    $network facility, to make $network available in runlevel 0 and 6.
  * Try to make update-bootsystem-insserv more robust on restores.
    Move conversion logs and related files to /var/lib/insserv.

insserv (1.08.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * New flag -k for check-initd-order to look at the stop sequence instead
    of the start sequence.
  * Correct override files for acpid, alsa, alsa-utils, apmd,
    hwclockfirst.sh, ifupdown, modutils, networking, nullmailer,
    openbsd-inetd, pcmcia, procps.sh, and update-hostname.
  * Remove override files for bootlogd, bootmisc.sh, checkfs.sh,
    checkroot.sh, glibc.sh, halt, hostname.sh, module-init-tools,
    mountall.sh, mountdevsubfs.sh, mountnfs.sh, reboot, rmnologin,
    sendsigs, single, stop-bootlogd, umountfs umountnfs.sh and urandom
    as the scripts themselves now have correct dependency information
    in them.
  * With the current patches and dependency info, insserv generate
    correct shutdown order.  (Closes: #350188)

insserv (1.08.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change update-bootsystem-insserv to refuse to convert the boot
    system if there are dependency loops.
  * New patch 37_consistent_path to make more consistent log output.
  * Adjust the the rules file to make sure we build using the compiler options
    specified there.
  * New patch 33_debian_localok making .local a valid ending,
    to accept script names like 'rc.local'.
  * New patch 38_debuginfo to improve the debug output.
  * New patch 39_debianlvl.dpatch to handle rcS.d/ a bit better.
  * Add override for mountdevsubfs.sh, documenting its
    relation to udev.
  * Add override for stop-bootlogd, documenting that it should come late,
    after rmnologin.
  * Make it easier to enable the dependency based boot system by
    adding a fairly well hidden debconf question to activate it.
  * Adjust the override files for dns-clean, hotplug, hotplug-net,
    hwclock.sh, keymap.sh, libdevmapper1.00, libdevmapper1.01,
    libdevmapper1.02, modutils, nviboot and procps.sh to make sure
    they only start in runlevel S.
  * Adjust override file for acpid, nstxd and nstxcd, to make sure
    they are not started in runlevel S.
  * Adjust override file for makedev and rmnologin, there is
    no reason to add stop links for them.
  * Remove 'S' from all override files listing it in should-stop.  It
    never make sense to add stop scripts in rcS.d/.

    and libnss-ldap.

    after /usr/ is mounted.

    problems. (Closes: #386301)

    keymap.sh itself (bug #386338).
  * Update 20_overrides.dpatch to new version of the source.
