"Enabling this will reorder all the scripts in /etc/rc*.d/ using the "
"dependency information provided in each script.  If such information is "
"missing, default dependency info will be used.  It will also change all S* "
"symlinks in rc0.d/ and rc6.d/ to K* symlinks, to make sure the way they are "
"used (with 'stop' argument) matches their names.  The change will only be "
"done after it is verified that it is safe to convert.  Disabling it when "
"enabled will try to revert the change."
